## 🚀 Featured Project: Customer Churn Analysis

### Overview
Analyzed 5,000+ customer records to identify churn drivers and develop retention strategies.

### Key Findings
- **37%** of month-to-month customers churn vs **3%** of 2-year contract customers
- Electronic check users have **2x** higher churn rate
- Customers without tech support churn at **32%** vs **15%** with support

### Business Impact
- Identified **$1.2M** annual revenue at risk from high-risk customers
- Proposed strategies to reduce churn by **5-10%**
