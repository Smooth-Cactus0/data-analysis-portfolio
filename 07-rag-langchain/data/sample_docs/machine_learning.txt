Machine Learning: A Comprehensive Overview

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems
that can learn from and make decisions based on data. Rather than being explicitly programmed
to perform a specific task, these systems use algorithms and statistical models to identify
patterns and make inferences from data.

Types of Machine Learning:

1. Supervised Learning: The algorithm learns from labeled training data, making predictions
   based on that data. Examples include classification and regression tasks. Common algorithms
   include linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines.

2. Unsupervised Learning: The algorithm works with unlabeled data, trying to find hidden
   patterns or intrinsic structures. Examples include clustering (K-means, hierarchical) and
   dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE).

3. Reinforcement Learning: The algorithm learns by interacting with an environment, receiving
   rewards or penalties for actions. It's used in robotics, game playing, and autonomous systems.

Key Concepts:
- Training data: The dataset used to train the model
- Features: Input variables used for predictions
- Labels: Target variables in supervised learning
- Model: The mathematical representation learned from data
- Overfitting: When a model performs well on training data but poorly on new data
- Underfitting: When a model is too simple to capture patterns in the data

Machine learning has applications in image recognition, speech processing, recommendation systems,
fraud detection, medical diagnosis, and many other fields.
