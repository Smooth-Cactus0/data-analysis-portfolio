Vector Databases: Powering Semantic Search

Vector databases are specialized database systems designed to store, manage, and query
high-dimensional vectors efficiently. They are essential for applications requiring
similarity search, including RAG systems, recommendation engines, and image search.

Key Concepts:

1. Vector Embeddings:
   - Dense numerical representations of data
   - Capture semantic meaning in vector space
   - Dimensionality typically ranges from 384 to 1536

2. Similarity Metrics:
   - Cosine Similarity: Measures angle between vectors
   - Euclidean Distance: Straight-line distance
   - Dot Product: Related to cosine for normalized vectors

3. Indexing Algorithms:
   - Flat Index: Exact search, O(n) complexity
   - IVF (Inverted File): Clustering-based approximate search
   - HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): Graph-based approximate search

Popular Vector Databases:

- FAISS: Facebook's library for efficient similarity search
- Chroma: Open-source, easy-to-use vector store
- Pinecone: Managed vector database service
- Weaviate: Open-source with GraphQL interface
- Milvus: Highly scalable open-source solution
- Qdrant: Rust-based with filtering support

Best Practices:
- Choose appropriate embedding model for your domain
- Consider index type based on dataset size
- Implement metadata filtering
- Monitor and optimize query performance
- Handle updates and deletions properly

Vector databases enable semantic search beyond keyword matching,
finding conceptually similar content even with different words.
