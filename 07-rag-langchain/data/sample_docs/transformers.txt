Transformers: The Architecture Revolutionizing AI

Transformers are a neural network architecture introduced in the paper "Attention Is All You Need"
(2017). They have become the foundation for modern NLP and are increasingly used in computer vision
and other domains.

Core Mechanism - Self-Attention:

The transformer's key innovation is the self-attention mechanism, which allows the model to weigh
the importance of different parts of the input when processing each element.

Q, K, V (Query, Key, Value):
- Query: What am I looking for?
- Key: What do I contain?
- Value: What information do I provide?

Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T / sqrt(d_k)) * V

Architecture Components:

1. Encoder:
   - Processes input sequence
   - Self-attention + feed-forward layers
   - Used in BERT-style models

2. Decoder:
   - Generates output sequence
   - Masked self-attention + cross-attention
   - Used in GPT-style models

3. Positional Encoding:
   - Adds sequence position information
   - Sine/cosine functions or learned embeddings

Notable Transformer Models:

- BERT: Bidirectional encoder for understanding
- GPT: Decoder-only for generation
- T5: Encoder-decoder for text-to-text
- ViT: Vision Transformer for images
- DALL-E: Multimodal generation

Transformers scale well with data and compute, enabling the development
of large language models with billions of parameters.
