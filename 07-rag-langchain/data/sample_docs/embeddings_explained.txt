Text Embeddings: Representing Meaning as Numbers

Text embeddings are dense vector representations that capture the semantic meaning of text.
They transform words, sentences, or documents into numerical vectors where similar meanings
are positioned closer together in the vector space.

Evolution of Embeddings:

1. One-Hot Encoding (Traditional):
   - Sparse vectors with vocabulary size
   - No semantic information
   - High dimensionality

2. Word2Vec (2013):
   - Dense vectors (typically 300 dimensions)
   - Learned from context (Skip-gram, CBOW)
   - Captures semantic relationships

3. GloVe (2014):
   - Global Vectors for Word Representation
   - Combines global statistics with local context
   - Pre-trained on large corpora

4. Contextual Embeddings (2018+):
   - Different representations based on context
   - BERT, ELMo, GPT embeddings
   - Handle polysemy (words with multiple meanings)

5. Sentence Embeddings:
   - sentence-transformers library
   - Models like all-MiniLM-L6-v2, all-mpnet-base-v2
   - Optimized for semantic similarity

Properties of Good Embeddings:
- Similar items have high cosine similarity
- Analogies preserved (king - man + woman ≈ queen)
- Clustering of related concepts
- Transfer to downstream tasks

Applications:
- Semantic search
- Document similarity
- Clustering and classification
- RAG retrieval
- Recommendation systems

Choosing embedding models involves trade-offs between
speed, quality, and dimensionality.
