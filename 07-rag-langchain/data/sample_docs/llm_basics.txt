Large Language Models: Foundation of Modern NLP

Large Language Models (LLMs) are neural networks trained on massive text corpora
that can generate human-like text and perform various language tasks. They represent
the current state of the art in natural language processing.

How LLMs Work:

1. Architecture:
   - Transformer-based (usually decoder-only)
   - Billions of parameters
   - Attention mechanisms for context

2. Training:
   - Pre-training: Self-supervised on web text
   - Next token prediction objective
   - Massive compute requirements

3. Capabilities:
   - Text generation
   - Question answering
   - Summarization
   - Translation
   - Code generation
   - Reasoning (to some extent)

Major LLM Families:

- GPT (OpenAI): GPT-3.5, GPT-4
- Claude (Anthropic): Claude 2, Claude 3
- LLaMA (Meta): Open-weights models
- Mistral: Efficient open models
- Gemini (Google): Multimodal capabilities

Using LLMs Effectively:

- Prompt Engineering: Crafting effective inputs
- Few-shot Learning: Providing examples in prompt
- Chain-of-Thought: Encouraging step-by-step reasoning
- RAG: Grounding with retrieved context
- Fine-tuning: Adapting for specific tasks

Limitations:
- Hallucinations (generating false information)
- Knowledge cutoff (outdated information)
- Context length limits
- Computational cost
- Bias from training data

LLMs are powerful tools when used appropriately,
especially when combined with retrieval systems.
