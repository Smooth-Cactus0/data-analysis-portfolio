Retrieval-Augmented Generation: Enhancing LLMs with External Knowledge

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines the generative capabilities
of large language models with information retrieval from external knowledge bases. This approach
addresses key limitations of pure LLMs, such as hallucinations and outdated knowledge.

RAG Pipeline Components:

1. Document Ingestion:
   - Load documents from various sources (PDF, web, databases)
   - Parse and clean text content
   - Extract metadata

2. Chunking:
   - Split documents into smaller segments
   - Balance context preservation with retrieval precision
   - Strategies: fixed-size, recursive, semantic

3. Embedding Generation:
   - Convert text chunks to vector representations
   - Models: sentence-transformers, OpenAI embeddings
   - Capture semantic meaning in vector space

4. Vector Storage:
   - Index embeddings for efficient retrieval
   - Databases: FAISS, Chroma, Pinecone, Weaviate
   - Enable similarity search at scale

5. Retrieval:
   - Find relevant documents for a query
   - Methods: similarity search, MMR, hybrid
   - Reranking for improved precision

6. Generation:
   - Provide retrieved context to LLM
   - Generate grounded responses
   - Include citations/sources

Benefits of RAG:
- Reduced hallucinations through grounding
- Access to current information
- Domain-specific knowledge
- Transparency with source citations

RAG is used in enterprise search, customer support, research assistants,
and knowledge management systems.
