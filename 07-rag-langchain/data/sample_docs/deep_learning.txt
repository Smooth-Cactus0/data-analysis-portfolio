Deep Learning: Neural Networks at Scale

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning based on artificial neural networks with multiple
layers. These networks are called "deep" because they have many hidden layers between input and
output, allowing them to learn increasingly abstract representations of data.

Architecture Components:

1. Input Layer: Receives the raw data
2. Hidden Layers: Process and transform data through weighted connections
3. Output Layer: Produces the final prediction or classification
4. Activation Functions: Non-linear functions (ReLU, sigmoid, tanh) that enable learning complex patterns

Types of Deep Neural Networks:

- Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN): Basic architecture where information flows in one direction
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): Specialized for image and spatial data processing
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN): Handle sequential data like time series and text
- Transformers: Use attention mechanisms for parallel processing of sequences
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN): Two networks competing to generate realistic data

Training Deep Networks:
- Backpropagation: Algorithm for computing gradients
- Optimization: Gradient descent variants (SGD, Adam, RMSprop)
- Regularization: Dropout, batch normalization, weight decay
- Data augmentation: Artificially expanding training data

Deep learning has achieved state-of-the-art results in computer vision, natural language
processing, speech recognition, and game playing.
