Natural Language Processing: Understanding Human Language

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field at the intersection of computer science,
artificial intelligence, and linguistics. Its goal is to enable computers to understand,
interpret, and generate human language in useful ways.

Core NLP Tasks:

1. Text Classification: Categorizing text into predefined categories
   - Sentiment analysis (positive/negative/neutral)
   - Topic classification
   - Spam detection

2. Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifying entities in text
   - People, organizations, locations
   - Dates, quantities, monetary values

3. Machine Translation: Converting text between languages
   - Neural machine translation (NMT)
   - Sequence-to-sequence models

4. Question Answering: Extracting answers from text
   - Reading comprehension
   - Knowledge-based QA

5. Text Generation: Creating coherent text
   - Language modeling
   - Summarization
   - Dialogue systems

Key Technologies:

- Word Embeddings: Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText
- Transformers: BERT, GPT, T5, RoBERTa
- Attention Mechanisms: Self-attention, cross-attention
- Pre-training: Learning representations from large corpora
- Fine-tuning: Adapting pre-trained models for specific tasks

NLP applications include chatbots, virtual assistants, content recommendation,
automated customer service, and information extraction.
